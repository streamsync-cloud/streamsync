# Custom components

It's possible to extend Streamsync with custom component templates. 

They're developed using Vue 3 and TypeScript. Once transpiled, they can be used by copying them to the `extensions/` folder of any project.

::: tip Custom components behave exactly like built-in ones
They are just as performant, can contain other components, and offer the same Builder experience. They only differ from built-in components in the way that they're bundled and imported.
:::

## Architecture

Streamsync frontend compiles to a collection of static assets that is distributed in the Python package. These static assets are then served via FastAPI.

During initialisation time, the server scans the `extensions/` folder in the project folder and looks for `.css` and `.js` files. This folder is also served, similarly to `static/`. If it finds any valid files in `extensions/`, it shares the list with clients and tells them to dynamically import these files during runtime.

_Extensions_ and _custom templates_ are currently synonyms, but this might change in order to accommodate other extension capabilities.

Dependencies are [_provided_](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-dependency-injection.html) using injection symbols and can be _injected_ to be used by the component template. These include `evaluatedFields`, which contain the current values of the editable fields. Injected dependencies are fully typed, making  development easier.

[Rollup's `external` feature](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#external), invoked via Vite, allows for extensions to be compiled without dependencies and link those during runtime. Therefore, extensions aren't bundled to be standalone, but rather to work as a piece of a puzzle.

## Anatomy of a template

A template defines how a certain component is rendered. For example, `corebutton` defines how _Button_ components are rendered.

Streamsync component templates are purely frontend-based. **They are Vue 3 templates that extend the Vue specification** via a [custom option](https://vuejs.org/api/utility-types.html#componentcustomoptions), `streamsync`. This _custom option_ defines all the Streamsync-specific behaviour of the component. For example, its `fields` property establishes which fields will be editable via Builder.

### Simple example

This example shows a template for _Bubble Message_, a simple demo component with one editable field, `text`.   

```vue
<template>
	<div class="BubbleMessage">
        <div class="triangle"></div>
        <div class="message">

            <!-- Shows the current value of the field "text" -->
            
            {{ fields.text.value }}
        </div>
	</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
export default {    
    streamsync: {
		name: "Bubble Message",
		description: "Shows a message in the shape of a speech bubble.",
		category: "Content",
		
        // Fields will be editable via Streamsync Builder
        
        fields: {
			text: {
				name: "Text",
				type: FieldType.Text,
			},
		},

        // Preview field is used in the Component Tree

		previewField: "text",
	},
};
</script>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { FieldType } from "../streamsyncTypes";
import injectionKeys from "../injectionKeys";
import { inject } from "vue";

/*
The values for the fields defined earlier in the custom option
will be available using the evaluatedFields injection symbol.
*/

const fields = inject(injectionKeys.evaluatedFields);
</script>

<style scoped>
/* ... */
</style>
```

The code above will make _Bubble Message_ available in Builder.

## Developing templates

### Run a local server

To get started, clone the [Streamsync repository](https://github.com/streamsync-cloud/streamsync) from GitHub. 

To develop custom templates, at least in a developer-friendly way, you'll need a frontend development server with instant reloads.

The frontend code for Streamsync can be found in the folder `ui`. With Node and npm in your system, run `npm install` to install dependencies, and start the server with support for custom component templates using `npm run custom.dev`.

```sh
cd ui
npm install

# "custom.dev" links templates in "custom_components/"
# "dev" runs the server without them 

npm run custom.dev
```

The command above will start a frontend server, but won't be of much use by itself â€”a backend is needed. The frontend development server proxies backend requests to port 5000.

Start Streamsync via command line, specifying the option `--port 5000`, to provide a backend in that port. It's recommended to create a new app for testing the template you're developing.

```sh
streamsync create customtester
streamsync edit customtester --port 5000
```

You should now be able to access Streamsync via the URL provided by Vite, e.g. `http://localhost:5174`. In Builder's _Toolkit_, you should see the sample component, _Balloon Message_. Add it to your tester application.

### Create a new component

Go to `ui/src/custom_components/` and open the Vue single-file components, i.e. the `.vue` files. These files contain comments that will help you get started. Try editing the provided templates, you should see changes reflected.

::: tip
You can also have a look at the built-in component templates, since their syntax is equivalent. They can be found in the `ui/src/core_components/` folder.
:::

You can get started by duplicating one of these examples. Make sure you add the new template to the entrypoint, as discussed below.

### Define entrypoint

For custom component templates to be taken into account, they need to be accessible from the entrypoint.

Edit `ui/src/custom_components/index.ts` to define which templates you wish to export and under which identifiers.

```ts

// Import the templates

import BubbleMessage from './BubbleMessage.vue';
import BubbleMessageAdvanced from './BubbleMessageAdvanced.vue';

// Export an object with the ids and the templates as default

export default {
    "bubblemessage": BubbleMessage,
    "bubblemessageadvanced": BubbleMessageAdvanced
}
```

A single or multiple templates can be specified. Take into account that they will all be exported, and later imported, together.

## Bundling templates

### Pack and collect

Execute `npm run custom.build`, this will generate the output `.js` and `.css` files into `ui/custom_components_dist`.

```sh
# "build" builds the entire frontend
# "custom.build" only builds the custom templates 

npm run custom.build
```

Collect the files from `ui/custom_components_dist` and pack them in a folder such as `my_custom_bubbles`. 

### Try them

The folder containing the generated files, e.g. `my_custom_bubbles`, can now be placed in the `extensions/` folder of any Streamsync project. It'll be automatically detected during server startup.

### Distribute your components

You can distribute your components on pypi. For this to work, your project must contain a package whose name starts with `streamsync_` and this package must contain an ``extensions`` folder.

The template [`FabienArcellier/streamsync_bubblemessage`](https://github.com/FabienArcellier/streamsync_bubblemessage/tree/master) provides a skeleton to simply create a package without needing to understand the details of compilation.
