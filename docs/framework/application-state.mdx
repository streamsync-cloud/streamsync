title: "Application state"
---

Each session is assigned a unique application state by the Framework.

## Initializing state

To set the initial application state, use the `wf.init_state()` method with a dictionary argument. 

<Tip>
All user sessions will start with a clone of this initial state.
</Tip>

```py
import writer as wf

# Define the initial state
initial_state = wf.init_state({
    "counter": 0,
})

# Define an event handler that modifies the state
# It receives the session state as an argument and mutates it
def increment(state):
    state["counter"] += 1
```

In the above example, each session begins with a `counter` at 0. As users interact with the application and activate event handlers, their session's `counter` value will change. For instance, if a user triggers the `increment` handler three times, their counter will increase to 3.

To access the `counter` value in the Builder, use @{counter}.

### Managing nested state elements

To include nested elements in your state, use nested dictionaries:

```python
# Example of nested state initialization
wf.init_state({
    "counter": 0,
    "my_app": {
        "title": "Nested value"
    }
})
```

You can reference nested elements in the Builder as `@{my_app.title}`.

### Backend-only state elements

By default, all of the elements in the session state are sent to the front-end.

<Warning> 
All state elements are transmitted to the front-end by default, regardless of their visibility in the user interface.
</Warning>

To keep certain state elements private (back-end-only), prefix them with an underscore `_`. This is useful in several scenarios:

1. When data synchronization to the front-end is unnecessary.
2. When data cannot be serialized for the front-end, such as database connections.
3. When data is sensitive to the specific session and should remain confidential.

These elements remain in the back-end and cannot be accessed from the Builder.

## Managing files and binary data

In components where the Builder interfaces with external data, such as images, it often requires the use of data URLs. The source for an _Image_ component, for example, can be a standard URL or a data URL.

Packing Files and Binary Data: Files and binary data can be converted to data URLs before they are sent to the front-end. Use `wf.pack_file()` and `wf.pack_bytes()` for this purpose. The `mime_type` argument, while optional, specifies the media type, helping the browser to correctly handle the data.

```python
import writer as wf

# Initialize state with various data types
wf.init_state({
    # Reference a file by its filesystem path
    "sales_spreadsheet": wf.pack_file("sales_spreadsheet.xlsx"),

    # Use a file-like object that implements a .read() method
    "main_image": wf.pack_file(image_file, mime_type="image/jpeg"),

    # Convert raw bytes specifying a MIME type
    "my_bytes": wf.pack_bytes(b"\x31\x33\x33\x37", mime_type="text/plain"),

    # Directly assign raw bytes without a MIME type
    "my_raw_bytes": b"\x31\x33\x33\x37",
})
```

## Handling non-standard data types

The front-end cannot directly display complex data types such as Pandas dataframes or Matplotlib figures. Such objects must be serialized before being sent.

  <Tab title="Matplotlib figures">
    Matplotlib figures are converted to PNG data URLs, which can be shown using a standard _Image_ component.

    ```python
    wf.init_state({
        "my_matplotlib_fig": fig,
    })
    ```

    The element can be used in an _Image_ component in the Builder by setting the source to `@{my_matplotlib_fig}`. Alternatively, as data inside a _File Download_ component.

    Plotly graphs are converted to Plotly JS specifications, using JSON. They can be used in _Plotly Graph_ components.

  <Tab title="Altair charts">
    Altair charts are converted to Vega Lite specifications, based on JSON. They can be used in _Vega Lite Chart_ components.

    Pandas dataframes are converted to JSON and can be used in _Dataframe_ components.
